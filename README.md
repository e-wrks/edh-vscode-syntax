# Minimum Syntax Highlight for Đ (Edh)

This VSCode extension provides minimum syntax highlighting for
[Đ (Edh)](https://github.com/e-wrks/edh)

Best experience with the bundled **Đ (Edh) - Calm Warm** theme.

A few other themes are also bundled, e.g. one based on **Dark +**,
and another based on **Groovy Lambda**.
